## Graph Theory
Repo for experimenting with graph theory in JS

**Progress**
* Randomly generated undirected, weighted graph implemented with adjacency list
* Implemented Dijkstra's algorithm to traverse the graph
* Visual representations

**Plans**
1. Learn about fundamentals of different types of graphs	
2. Implement the different graphs
3. Learn important algorithms, how they function, and implementation
4. Solve some graph theory problems
5. TBD
